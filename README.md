Implementation of Lagrangian finite element method for the finite element solution of the 2D equations of motion for a compressible non-linearly elastic solid which obeys the Kirchhoï¬€-St. Venant constitutive law. Models the impact of a rectangular solid on a frictionless rigid foundation. This work was part of a course project for the University of California, Berkeley advanced graduate course ME280B: Finite Element Methods in Non-linear Continua instructed by Professor Panos Papadopoulos.
