# nonlinear-lagrangian-fem
Implementation of Lagrangian finite element method for the finite element solution of the 2D equations of motion for a compressible non-linearly elastic solid which obeys the Kirchhoï¬€-St. Venant constitutive law. Models the impact of a rectangular solid on a frictionless rigid foundation.
